The Unthrottled Home Network: AT&T Fiber & Netgear R8000 Setup
Author: [Matthew Dixon/Musician2004i] Date: [12/01/2025] 
Project Goal: To establish a high-performance, secure home network by bypassing the default AT&T Gateway functionality and 
delegating all routing and Wi-Fi control to a powerful, owner-managed router (Netgear Nighthawk R8000).

# 🌐 The Unthrottled Home Network: AT&T Fiber & Netgear R8000 Setup

**Project by:** [Your Name/GitHub Handle]
**Date:** [Current Date]
**Goal:** Achieve maximum network control and performance by configuring the AT&T BGW320-505 in IP Passthrough mode, delegating all routing and Wi-Fi functionality to a powerful, owner-managed Netgear Nighthawk X6 R8000. This setup eliminates common ISP router limitations and improves security.

## 💻 Project Prerequisites (The Gear)

| Device | Role in the Network | Key Information |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AT&T BGW320-505** | Internet Service Provider (ISP) Gateway (The Fiber Converter) | ISP-provided device. Its role is minimized to pass the public internet IP. |
| **Netgear Nighthawk X6 R8000** | Primary Router (The Brain) | Handles all Wi-Fi, DHCP, NAT, and security/firewall rules. |
| **Bark Home** | Network Security/Parental Controls | Integrated device for enforcing content filtering. |
| **Verizon Home 5G Router** | Backup/Redundancy | Used as an independent failover connection. |

## 🚀 Phase 1: Liberating the Internet IP (IP Passthrough)

This critical phase forces the AT&T Gateway to stop acting as a router and only pass the public internet address to the Nighthawk. All configuration steps are detailed in the `phase1_att_config/passthrough_setup.txt` file.

### Key Steps Summary

1.  **Identify Nighthawk WAN MAC:** Obtain the MAC Address from the R8000 sticker.
2.  **Re-IP the Gateway Subnet:** Move the BGW320 from `192.168.1.x` to a unique subnet (e.g., `192.168.2.254`) to prevent Double NAT conflicts with the Nighthawk.
3.  **Enable IP Passthrough:** Configure the BGW320 to use `DHCPS-Fixed` mode and point it specifically to the Nighthawk's WAN MAC address.
4.  **Disable Wi-Fi:** Turn off all Wi-Fi radio bands on the BGW320.
5.  **Connect and Verify:** Connect the BGW320's LAN port to the Nighthawk's WAN port. Verify the Nighthawk receives the public IP.

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Network Hardening (Netgear Configuration)

With the Nighthawk R8000 in control, we must secure it. All essential hardening steps are listed in the `phase2_netgear_hardening/security_checklist.md` file.

### Key Hardening Areas

* **Access Control:** Change default credentials and disable external access.
* **Security Features:** Disable vulnerable services like UPnP and WPS.
* **Wi-Fi Security:** Enforce WPA2-PSK (AES) or WPA3 and use strong, long passphrases.
* **IoT Isolation:** Utilize the Guest Network feature to segment less secure IoT devices (smart plugs, sensors) away from sensitive computing devices.

## 🔗 Phase 3: Redundancy and Integration

This phase covers integrating the security appliance (Bark Home) and establishing the backup internet connection. Detailed plans are in `phase3_redundancy/failover_plan.md`.

### Bark Home Integration

The Bark Home is physically connected to a **LAN port** on the **Nighthawk R8000**.  Because the Nighthawk is the DHCP server, the Bark Home can see and enforce rules on all connected devices.

### Verizon 5G Failover

The Verizon Router is kept completely separate and broadcasts its own distinct Wi-Fi SSID (e.g., `EMERGENCY-5G-Backup`). This allows for a **manual failover** procedure, ensuring internet connectivity during any AT&T service interruption.
